# Enhanced Situational Awareness

The browser agent now includes advanced situational awareness capabilities that help it better understand the current page context and user requests before choosing actions.

## Overview

The situational awareness system analyzes:

- **Current page state and type** (login, search, form, checkout, etc.)
- **User task intent and complexity** (navigation, interaction, input, search, etc.)
- **Contextual relevance** between the task and available page elements
- **Potential obstacles and success indicators**
- **Recommended approaches** based on the situation

## Key Features

### 1. Page Type Classification

The agent automatically identifies the type of page it's on:

- **Login pages**: Pages with password fields
- **Search pages**: Pages with search input fields
- **Form pages**: Pages with multiple form elements
- **Checkout pages**: Pages with cart/checkout elements
- **Shopping pages**: Pages with shopping cart elements
- **General pages**: Standard web pages

### 2. Task Intent Analysis

The agent analyzes user requests to understand:

- **Navigation intent**: "go to", "navigate", "visit"
- **Interaction intent**: "click", "press", "select"
- **Input intent**: "type", "enter", "fill"
- **Search intent**: "search", "find", "look for"
- **Extraction intent**: "get", "extract", "read"
- **Verification intent**: "check", "verify", "confirm"
- **Multi-step intent**: Tasks with "and", "then", "after"

### 3. Contextual Relevance Scoring

The agent calculates how relevant the current page is to the user's task:

- Matches task keywords with page elements
- Identifies relevant interactive elements
- Provides relevance scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- Highlights the most relevant elements

### 4. AI-Powered Situation Analysis

Uses GPT-4 to provide intelligent recommendations:

- **Recommended approach**: direct, exploratory, cautious, aggressive
- **Potential obstacles**: identified issues that might occur
- **Success indicators**: what would indicate successful completion
- **Confidence level**: how confident the agent is in its analysis
- **Reasoning**: explanation of the analysis

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The situational awareness is automatically used in all task executions:

```python
from agent.browser_agent import BrowserAgent

agent = BrowserAgent()
agent.start()

# The agent will automatically analyze the situation before executing
result = agent.execute_task("Search for 'browser automation'")
```

### Manual Situation Analysis

You can manually get the current situation analysis:

```python
# Get analysis for a specific task
situation = agent.get_current_situation_analysis("Fill out the login form")
print(f"Page type: {situation['page_type']}")
print(f"Recommended approach: {situation['recommended_approach']}")
print(f"Potential obstacles: {situation['potential_obstacles']}")

# Get analysis for current page without specific task
current_situation = agent.get_current_situation_analysis()
print(f"Current page type: {current_situation['page_analysis']['type']}")
```

### Complex Task Execution

For complex multi-step tasks, the agent uses situational awareness at each step:

```python
# The agent will analyze the situation before each step
result = agent.execute_task("Navigate to the login page and fill out the form")
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The agent provides detailed logging of its situational awareness:

```
üß† Situational awareness: search page, direct approach
‚ö†Ô∏è Potential obstacles: ['captcha', 'rate limiting']
üìä Situation analysis complete - Page type: search
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Action Selection**: The agent chooses more appropriate actions based on page context
2. **Improved Success Rate**: Understanding obstacles helps avoid common failures
3. **Smarter Error Recovery**: Better recovery strategies based on situation analysis
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: More natural and contextually aware interactions
5. **Debugging Support**: Detailed analysis helps understand agent behavior

## Example Scenarios

### Login Page Scenario

```
Task: "Login with username 'test' and password 'password'"
Analysis:
- Page type: login
- Recommended approach: cautious
- Potential obstacles: ['captcha', 'invalid credentials']
- Success indicators: ['redirect to dashboard', 'welcome message']
```

### Search Page Scenario

```
Task: "Search for 'browser automation tools'"
Analysis:
- Page type: search
- Recommended approach: direct
- Potential obstacles: ['no results', 'slow loading']
- Success indicators: ['search results displayed', 'results count shown']
```

### Form Page Scenario

```
Task: "Fill out the contact form"
Analysis:
- Page type: form
- Recommended approach: exploratory
- Potential obstacles: ['required fields', 'validation errors']
- Success indicators: ['form submitted', 'success message']
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see situational awareness in action:

```bash
python test_situational_awareness.py
```

This will demonstrate:

- Basic situational analysis
- Search page analysis
- Complex task execution
- Error recovery with situational awareness

## Configuration

The situational awareness system uses the same OpenAI API key as the main agent. No additional configuration is required.

## Performance Impact

The situational analysis adds minimal overhead:

- ~1-2 seconds for simple pages
- ~2-3 seconds for complex pages with many elements
- Analysis is cached during task execution to avoid repeated calls

The benefits of better action selection typically outweigh the small performance cost.
